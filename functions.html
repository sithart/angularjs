<p>What are Functions?

When first learning how to calculate the area of a rectangle, thereâ€™s a sequence of steps to calculate the correct answer:

    Measure the width of the rectangle.
    Measure the height of the rectangle.
    Multiply the width and height of the rectangle.

With practice, you can calculate the area of the rectangle without being instructed with these three steps every time.

We can calculate the area of one rectangle with the following code:</p>
<script>

// Area of the rectangle
const width = 10;
const height = 6;
const area =  width * height;
console.log(area); //
// Imagine being asked to calculate the area of three different rectangles:
// Area of the first rectangle
const width1 = 10;
const height1 = 6;
const area1 =  width1 * height1;

// Area of the second rectangle
const width2 = 4;
const height2 = 9;
const area2 =  width2 * height2;

// Area of the third rectangle
const width3 = 10;
const height3 = 10;
const area3 =  width3 * height3;

// default parameters
function greeting (name = 'stranger') {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
}

greeting('Nick') // Output: Hello, Nick!
greeting() // Output: Hello, stranger!
// Return keyword
function rectangleArea(width, height) {
  if (width < 0 || height < 0) {
    return 'You need positive integers to calculate area!';
  }
  return width * height;
}

// Arrow Functions
const rectangleArea = (width, height) => {
  let area = width * height;
  return area;
};
</script>
